# Mtlab-and-simulink-model-for-simulator
Developed a custom MATLAB/Simulink flight dynamics model integrated with FlightGear. Simulates aircraft response in real time and outputs flight parameters (yaw, pitch, roll, throttle, etc.) for analysis, control law testing, and flight visualization.
This project showcases a custom flight simulator developed using MATLAB/Simulink and integrated with FlightGear for real-time visualization. At its core, it features a flight dynamics model (FDM) capable of simulating key aircraft responses such as throttle, yaw, pitch, and roll. The model exchanges data with FlightGear, allowing the simulation to be both visual and interactive, while simultaneously logging critical flight parameters for analysis. Designed to serve as a testbed for flight control systems, the simulator supports implementation of control laws such as PID and LQR, and can be extended to include joystick/gamepad inputs or autopilot logic. By bridging engineering-grade modeling with a high-fidelity visualization environment, this project creates a powerful platform for aerospace research, stability analysis, and pilot-in-the-loop experiments.
